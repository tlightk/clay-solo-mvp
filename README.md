*"A person's name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language." - Dale Carnegie*

When I read Dale Carnegie's book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" this quote was one that really stuck with me. I took that advice to heart so much that when I moved to Japan and started networking and making new friends, I would take notes of the new people I meet as to not forget them. I tried my best to keep it consistent - their name, a nickname if they had one, what age they looked to be (usually with a question mark), and a short description of what they do and how we met. This helped me a lot since I was not very good at remembering names. And since I was so diligent with this habit there have been countless times that it's saved me from embarassing moments. Even more astonishing though is the fact that I could feel the people around me impressed at my ability to remember people's details so well. The truth is, it just took a little extra effort - but those little efforts made real big differences!

I did my note-taking with the default note app on my phone, but deep down I really wanted to make something tailored for this specific situation, so that is how this full stack app was born!
