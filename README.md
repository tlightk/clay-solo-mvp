*"A person's name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language." - Dale Carnegie*

When I read Dale Carnegie's book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" this quote was one that really stuck with me. I took that advice to heart so much that when I moved to Japan and started networking and making new friends, I would take notes of the new people I meet as to not forget them. I tried my best to keep it consistent - their name, a nickname if they had one, what age they looked to be (usually with a question mark), and a short description of what they do and how we met. This helped me a lot since I was not very good at remembering names. And since I was so diligent with this habit there have been countless times that it's saved me from embarassing moments. Even more astonishing though is the fact that I could feel the people around me impressed at my ability to remember people's details so well. The truth is, it just took a little extra effort - but those little efforts made real big differences!

I did my note-taking with the default note app on my phone, but deep down I really wanted to make something tailored for this specific situation, so that is how this full stack app was born!

## Tech Stack
This is a MEVN app and uses the four techs at its core:
* MongoDB
* Express
* Vue
* Node

Other tech used:
* Mongoose
* Axios

## Project setup
Install the necessary dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
Split your terminal and on one side, run nodemon (hot-reloadinng) with this:
```
npm run dev
```
and on the other terminal, run this:
```
npm run serve
```

Now, you can open up your browser and view the app on
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

With hot-reloading (nodemon), you should be able to see any changes made on the front end by simply refreshing the browser.

## Deployment
namaewa is deployed via heroku [here](https://namaewa-production.herokuapp.com/).

## Work in Progress
* Add a way to delete entries
* Add a way to update entries
* Implement a login feature using JWT
* Spice up the app and make it look nicer
* Adjust styling to make the app mobile-friendly
